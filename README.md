# dotnet-sdk-enterprise-server

Since GitHub Enterprise Server has [multiple supported versions](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server/admin/all-releases) at any given time, this project uses branches to manage each version. 

See [the repository's branches](https://github.com/octokit/dotnet-sdk-enterprise-server/branches) to view your desired version.
